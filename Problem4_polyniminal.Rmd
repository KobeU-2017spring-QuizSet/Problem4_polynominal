# Introduction

Define the polynomial function described below.

\[
p(x) = a_0 + a_1 x +a_2x^2+ ... + a_nx^n = \sum^n_{i=0} a_i x^i
\]


Show out put when $x=1, 2,..., 10$ when $n=2$


In this exercise, all of coefficients is one, except for $a_0 = 11$ but you are supposed to write a general code. In other word, your function has to be used to any $n$ not only for $n=2$.

# Question
- write a code to caluculate polunominal
- set $a_0 = 0$ and $a_i = 1, i \geq 1$
- set $n=2$
- At this time, you are supposed to write a code to caluculate $p(x) = 11 + x +x^2$.
